4.
Program to have a count of number of vowels and consonants in a
given string.

5.
Implementation of the Number Guessing Game.

	Make sure that the following criteria’s are taken care:
•	The guess number is generated by the program randomly. 
	However, you have the option of setting the range.
•	If the guessed number and the given number are same the 
	user wins. The program displays “You’ve WON the game…”
•	If the number given by the user is greater or lesser 
	appropriate message is displayed. Like 
	“Number is too big…” or “Number is too low…”
•	A maximum of FIVE chances are given. Even after FIVE 
	chances the number is not guessed rightly the following 
	message is displayed “You’ve have LOST the game…”

NOTE : Import the random module (import random) and use the randint 
method to generate a random number.

	DA  is 25% of the Basic Salary for Female gender and
	       20% for the Male gender
	PF  is 8% of the Basic Salary
	Net Pay = Basic + HRA + DA - PF
