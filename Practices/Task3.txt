Tasks
=====
Using List Comprehension technique do the following:

1. Find the Fahrenheit of the following temperatures given in Celsius

Celsius = [39.2, 36.5, 37.3, 37.8]

Refer to the formula from the previous Task.

2. Find Pythagorean triples for all the number in a range of 1 to N

3. Cross product of two sets
colours = [ "red", "green", "yellow", "blue" ]
things = [ "house", "car", "tree" ]

Tasks
=====
The following tasks are achieved in context to the facilitation done on
Modules.

1.	Create a module by name UDF, such that it holds all the user defined 
functions ( Refer Q1. and Q6 of the previous Task )

Write program which uses the UDF module and demonstrates
the use of the user defined functions.

2.	Create a module by name DefaultArgs, such that it holds all the user defined 
Functions which have default argument ( Refer Q7. and Q8 of the previous Task )

Write program which uses the DefaultArgs module and demonstrates
the use of the user defined functions with default arguments.

3.	Create a module by name KeyArgs, such that it holds all the user defined 
Functions which have keyword argument mechanism ( Refer Q9. and Q10 of the previous Task )

Write program which uses the KeyArgs module and demonstrates
the use of the user defined functions with keyword arguments.

4.	Create a module by name Recursion, such that it holds all the user defined 
Recursive Functions ( Refer Q11. and Q14 of the previous Task )

Write program which uses the Recursion module and demonstrates
the use of recursive functions. 

Give local name to the Recursion module function and execute them.

5.	Import the UDF module using the from statement 

		[a] with specific user defined function
		[b] with all user-defined function using “ * “

6.	If the modules are not being identified, we need to set the module search path.  Are your modules being executed if they are placed in a different directory, if no perform appropriate action such that they start working?

7.	Using the standard module “sys” change the primary and second prompts of the Python environment.

8.	Observe the different objects of the __builtins__ module.

9.	Create a package, such that we are in a position to use all our function created in the previous session as follows:

		MyFunctions
		MyFunctions.UDF
		MyFunctions.DefaultArgs
		MyFunctions.KeyArgs
		MyFunctions.Recursion
