=====

1.	Write user-defined function for the following

	To display a message 

	“Welcome to BANGALORE”
 	“Have a nice day!”

2.	Write a function which finds the cubes of numbers from 1 to 5.

3.	Write a function to do the following tasks

	[a] Check if the year passed as an argument is a leap year 
		or not.  
	[b] Check if the integer passed as an argument is Prime 
		or not.
      Return a Boolean value.

4.	Write a function to determine the roots of a quadratic 
		equation.

5.	Write a function which returns a tuple of the indices of 
	the two smallest values in list.

6.	Write a function to check the given character is:

	[a] A upper case letter,
	[b] A lower case letter,
	[c] A digit or
	[d] A special symbol

7.	Write a function with default argument value to compute 
	simple interest. The default rate of interest is 10% 
	otherwise the user specifies it.

8.	Write a function with default arguments to print the 
	specified character, the specified number of times.

	The default character is “ * “ and the default number is 40

	We should be able to call the function in the following
	ways:

	PrintChar()
	PrintChar('=')
	PrintChar('#', 30)


9.	Write a function which takes two argument, the first being 
	the temperature and the second being the character to 
	indicate whether the temperature is in Fahrenheit ( F ) 
	or Celsius ( C ).

	If the temperature is in Fahrenheit, the function should 
	calculate and return the Celsius equivalent and vice-versa.

	*Celsius = ( 5.0 / 9.0 ) * ( Fahrenheit – 32.0 )
	*Fahrenheit = (( 9.0 / 5.0 ) * Celsius ) + 32.0

	Use the keyword argument mechanism to implement the function.

10.	Write a function which takes three argument, the first being 
	the title, the second being the name and the third being the 
	message.

	Message(title, name, msg)

	Use the keyword argument mechanism and display the informatio
	with the following print function:    

	print( “%s %s \n %s”  % (title, name, msg))

11.	Write a recursive function to find the factorial of a number.

	[a] Check if the function is working properly or not.
	[b] Find the Binomial co-efficient   nCr = n! / (n – r )! * r!

12.	Write a recursive function to find the GCD of two positive 
	numbers.

	[a] Using the above function find the 
		LCM = ( m * n ) / GCD(m, n)

13.	Write a recursive function to get the Nth Fibonacci number.

14.	Write a recursive function to solve the problem of 
	Tower of Hanoi.

15.	Using the variable argument list mechanism write a function 
	which returns the sum of all the integers passed to it as 
	arguments.

16.	Write Python program to illustrate the different type of 
	scopes for a variable and the usage of global statement.

17.	Modify the Tower of Hanoi recursive function such that 
	function also gives a count of the number of disk moves.  
	The count is held in a global variable.

18.	Demonstrate the use of anonymous function using lambda.

	[a] To find the area of a right angle triangle
	[b] To find the volume of a box.
	[c] To convert inches to centimeters.

19.	Provide document strings for all the above user-defined 
	functions with text indicating their usage.
